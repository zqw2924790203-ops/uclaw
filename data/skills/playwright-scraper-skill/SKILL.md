# Playwright Scraper Skill

A Playwright-based web scraping OpenClaw Skill with anti-bot protection. Choose the best approach based on the target website's anti-bot level.

---

## 🎯 Use Case Matrix

| Target Website | Anti-Bot Level | Recommended Method | Script |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Regular Sites** | Low | web_fetch tool | N/A (built-in) |
| **Dynamic Sites** | Medium | Playwright Simple | `scripts/playwright-simple.js` |
| **Cloudflare Protected** | High | **Playwright Stealth** ⭐ | `scripts/playwright-stealth.js` |
| **YouTube** | Special | deep-scraper | Install separately |
| **Reddit** | Special | reddit-scraper | Install separately |

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
cd playwright-scraper-skill
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Simple Sites (No Anti-Bot)

Use OpenClaw's built-in `web_fetch` tool:

```bash
# Invoke directly in OpenClaw
Hey, fetch me the content from https://example.com
```

---

### 2️⃣ Dynamic Sites (Requires JavaScript)

Use **Playwright Simple**:

```bash
node scripts/playwright-simple.js "https://example.com"
```

**Example output:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "title": "Example Domain",
  "content": "...",
  "elapsedSeconds": "3.45"
}
```

---

### 3️⃣ Anti-Bot Protected Sites (Cloudflare etc.)

Use **Playwright Stealth**:

```bash
node scripts/playwright-stealth.js "https://m.discuss.com.hk/#hot"
```

**Features:**
- Hide automation markers (`navigator.webdriver = false`)
- Realistic User-Agent (iPhone, Android)
- Random delays to mimic human behavior
- Screenshot and HTML saving support

---

### 4️⃣ YouTube Video Transcripts

Use **deep-scraper** (install separately):

```bash
# Install deep-scraper skill
npx clawhub install deep-scraper

# Use it
cd skills/deep-scraper
node assets/youtube_handler.js "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Try web_fetch First
If the site doesn't have dynamic loading, use OpenClaw's `web_fetch` tool—it's fastest.

### 2. Need JavaScript? Use Playwright Simple
If you need to wait for JavaScript rendering, use `playwright-simple.js`.

### 3. Getting Blocked? Use Stealth
If you encounter 403 or Cloudflare challenges, use `playwright-stealth.js`.

### 4. Special Sites Need Specialized Skills
- YouTube → deep-scraper
- Reddit → reddit-scraper
- Twitter → bird skill

---

## 🔧 Customization

All scripts support environment variables:

```bash
# Set screenshot path
SCREENSHOT_PATH=/path/to/screenshot.png node scripts/playwright-stealth.js URL

# Set wait time (milliseconds)
WAIT_TIME=10000 node scripts/playwright-simple.js URL

# Enable headful mode (show browser)
HEADLESS=false node scripts/playwright-stealth.js URL

# Save HTML
SAVE_HTML=true node scripts/playwright-stealth.js URL

# Custom User-Agent
USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0 ..." node scripts/playwright-stealth.js URL
```

## 🛡️ Anti-Bot Techniques Summary

Lessons learned from our testing:

### ✅ Effective Anti-Bot Measures
1. **Hide `navigator.webdriver`** — Essential
2. **Realistic User-Agent** — Use real devices (iPhone, Android)
3. **Mimic Human Behavior** — Random delays, scrolling
4. **Avoid Framework Signatures** — Crawlee, Selenium are easily detected
5. **Use `addInitScript` (Playwright)** — Inject before page load

### ❌ Ineffective Anti-Bot Measures
1. **Only changing User-Agent** — Not enough
2. **Using high-level frameworks (Crawlee)** — More easily detected
3. **Docker isolation** — Doesn't help with Cloudflare

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: 403 Forbidden
**Solution:** Use `playwright-stealth.js`

### Issue: Cloudflare Challenge Page
**Solution:**
1. Increase wait time (10-15 seconds)
2. Try `headless: false` (headful mode sometimes has higher success rate)
3. Consider using proxy IPs

### Issue: Blank Page
**Solution:**
1. Increase `waitForTimeout`
2. Use `waitUntil: 'networkidle'` or `'domcontentloaded'`
3. Check if login is required

## 📝 Memory & Experience

### 2026-02-07 Discuss.com.hk Test Conclusions
